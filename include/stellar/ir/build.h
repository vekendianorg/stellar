// Model construction: walks every DIE in the binary and reconstructs a flat

//
// Two passes over the DIE stream are used, because DWARF references may point
// forward or backward:
//   Pass A  create a Type node for every type-defining DIE and record
//           offset -> node in an open-addressed table; collect members and
//           enumerators.
//   Pass B  resolve each node's DW_AT_type reference through that table, then
//           infer missing sizes.
//
// Only type-defining DIEs are retained. Members, enumerators and inheritance
// are captured; everything else (the ~92% of DIEs that are function-local) is
// skipped without materialisation, which is what keeps peak memory bounded.
