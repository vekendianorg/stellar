// Raw-mode terminal ownership: alternate screen, cursor, key decoding, size
// tracking and guaranteed restoration.
//
// The whole point of this file is the guarantee at the bottom of it. A TUI that
// exits with the cursor hidden, the alternate screen active, or the terminal in
// raw mode leaves the user's shell unusable until they run `reset`. So terminal
// state is owned by a single RAII type, restoration is idempotent, and it also
// runs from the signal handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP/SIGSEGV/SIGABRT.
