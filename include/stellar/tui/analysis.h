// The background analysis job behind the TUI's "run" action.
//
// Dumping the real target takes 30+ seconds. Everything the core does -- opening
// the container, walking 20M DIEs, building a multi-million-node type graph and
// writing a 300 MB dump -- is a single blocking call, so it cannot run on the
// thread that owns the terminal. This module wraps those *existing* core entry
// points in one worker thread and publishes what it can see into a copyable
// snapshot the UI polls on its own frame loop.
//
// Two rules shape the design:
//
//   * The snapshot is a plain value with no locks in it. The worker fills it
//     under one mutex; the UI copies it out under the same mutex and then reads
//     the copy with no synchronisation at all. A widget therefore cannot ever
//     block on, or be blocked by, the analysis.
//   * No analysis logic lives here. The mode decision, the model build and the
//     emitter are the core's, byte for byte, so a dump started from the TUI is
//     the same dump `stellar emit` would write.
