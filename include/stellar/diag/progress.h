// In-place progress reporting.
//
// Long stages (walking 20M DIEs, building a 3M-node type graph, writing a
// 300 MB dump) look like a hang without feedback. This writes a single
// terminal line that is rewritten in place with a carriage return, e.g.
//
//   [ 24%] DIEs: 12,450/50,000 (24%) | Types: 1,203/4,800 | Stage: DWARF
//
// Design constraints:
//   * cheap when disabled -- the hot path is one predictable branch, so adding
//     progress to a 20M-iteration loop costs nothing measurable
//   * cheap when enabled -- the clock is read at most every few thousand
//     updates rather than per update, and rendering reuses one buffer
//   * generic -- counters are named by the caller, nothing here knows what a
//     DIE or a field is
//   * tidy -- the line is erased before any error or summary is printed
